md.f:  The molecular dynamics code I used to perform simulations of molten alkali carbonates. I worked on Lennard-Jones parameterization and worked toward achieving molecular interactions that more closely resembled experimental data.

gr.f: This code calculates the g(r) or radial distribution function between alkali atoms in alkali carbonates.

interface.f: This code creates a box of lithium carbonate molecules to be used in a molecular dynamics simulation.
